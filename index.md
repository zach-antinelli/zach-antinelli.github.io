Hi, I am Zach. I live in Vancouver, WA (right across the river from Portland, OR). I am an enthusiastic Engineer that works in the technology space, mainly focusing on automation, operations and security. 

I love learning about new things. Currently I am expanding my knowledge of cloud concepts and security. In my free time I like learning about and keeping up with tech, playing and listening to music, fitness, the outdoors, and my dogs, Bubba and Bear (some images for you below).
