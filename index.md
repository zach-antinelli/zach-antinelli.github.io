Hi, I am Zach. I live in Vancouver, WA (right by Portland, OR). I love technology, music, fitness, the outdoors, but above all.. my dogs, Bubba and Bear!

This is my simple landing page to provide some info about myself and relevant resources. Here you can find links to my github, linkedin, email and a PDF copy of my current resume. 

Please feel free to reach out directly via email or connect with me on Linkedin.
